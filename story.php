			<p class="body">In Spring 2008, a group of ambitious men set forth to establish a chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon at Northeastern University. Beginning as an interest group, SOLID (Students Obtaining Leadership In Dedication) was first founded for the common goal of a lifelong brotherhood. Under the leadership of principal founder Jason Chu, we became a diverse group of college students committed to values such as academic achievement, social communication, personal growth, and moral consciousness. With the help and honorary guidance of Mac Mellish, Robert Chan, Hau Tran and the brothers of University of Massachusetts at Amherst, nine men succeeded in their goals and they were given the great honor and privilege of chartering Lambda Phi Epsilon during the mid-year convention held by newly instated Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>

			<p class="body">Although we were grateful for our experience at Northeastern University and proud of our accomplishments, we knew that we needed the Multicultural Greek Council to drive our organizational goals. Since April 2009, we began exhibiting consistent involvement with our community on and off campus. We expressed our determination in building connections with Greek life locally as well as developing stronger bonds with outside chapters. By April 2014, we had become a well-structured, ambitious, and passionate group.</p>

			<p class="body">Our determination and strength as an organization allowed us to prove our longevity and commitment to the ideals of Lambda Phi Epsilon and of the Council. On April 8, 2014, after five long years of dedication, under the leadership of Justin Kwan, Derrick Quach, and Ryan Ho, and with the concentrated efforts of initiated and interested members alike, the Northeastern University Multicultural Greek Council accepted our application and extended an invitation for Lambda Phi Epsilon to officially colonize at Northeastern University. With the support of the Northeastern University Multicultural Greek Council, Lambda Phi Epsilon, the many organizations on and off campus, and our own continued dedication we plan to fully commit ourselves to maintaining our strength in academics, brotherhood, leadership, and service for years to come.</p>
